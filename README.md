# moodofthenation

This is the final project of the cs50 web development with python and javascript course.The app is called 'moodofthenation', and it has one simple data - to show the 'mood' of the market in the most adorable way possible.

Here are the main endpoints of the app:
- An "index.html" (with a third party google authentication form).If logged in, it shows a dashboard.html file
- The dashboard.html file has four separate divisions- A current mood pane, moods in the previous hours ,a weekly mood trend graph and another page containing latest news api.
- There are two APIs which have been utilised for making this app - The ParalleDots Sentiment Analysis API and the NewsAPI.
- The sentiment analysis API is called hourly on a fresh new batch of articles from the NewsAPI, which converts it into a mood index to show on the webpage and the graph.
- The app is responsive as it uses Bootstrap rows and columns.
- The design and loading icons have been made using CSS.
- A tests.py file consisting of testcases

This app consists of various things we have learnt in the course (such as Flask, Javascript, SQL, APIs, python and many, many more).

This application is made using flask and runs on heroku.
